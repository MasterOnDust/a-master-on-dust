\section{Model setup}

Atmospheric forcing data for both FLEXPART and FLEXDUST is ERA5 global reanalysis developed at the European Center for Medium range Weather Forecast (ECWMF) \parencite{hersbach_era5_2020}. The ERA5 reanalysis assimilate large amount of observational data in order to provide the best estimate of the state of the atmosphere extending back to 1979. Compared to previous reanalysis dataset ERA5 provide high spatial resolution of $0.3\degree \times 0.3\degree$, with 3hourly temporal resolution. \todo{Need to show that ERA5 improve the model result}... The ERA5 data was downloaded from the ECWMF servers and processed into the GRIB format required by FLEXPART using the \verb|flex_extract| package \parencite{tipka_flex_extract_2020}. With \verb|flex_extract| version 7.1.0 there was introduce an improved method for disaggregating the precipiitation fields following the algorithm developed by \parencite{hittmeir_conservative_2018}, support for this new interpolation scheme has not been implemented in the current version of FLEXPART V10.4. Prior to version 7.1.0 a relative simple linear temporal interpolation was used,
