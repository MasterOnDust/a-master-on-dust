	abstract = {Within the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S), ECMWF is producing the ERA5 reanalysis which, once completed, will embody a detailed record of the global atmosphere, land surface and ocean waves from 1950 onwards. This new reanalysis replaces the ERA-Interim reanalysis (spanning 1979 onwards) which was started in 2006. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) Cy41r2 which was operational in 2016. ERA5 thus benefits from a decade of developments in model physics, core dynamics and data assimilation. In addition to a significantly enhanced horizontal resolution of 31 km, compared to 80 km for ERA-Interim, ERA5 has hourly output throughout, and an uncertainty estimate from an ensemble (3-hourly at half the horizontal resolution). This paper describes the general set-up of ERA5, as well as a basic evaluation of characteristics and performance, with a focus on the dataset from 1979 onwards which is currently publicly available. Re-forecasts from ERA5 analyses show a gain of up to one day in skill with respect to ERA-Interim. Comparison with radiosonde and PILOT data prior to assimilation shows an improved fit for temperature, wind and humidity in the troposphere, but not the stratosphere. A comparison with independent buoy data shows a much improved fit for ocean wave height. The uncertainty estimate reflects the evolution of the observing systems used in ERA5. The enhanced temporal and spatial resolution allows for a detailed evolution of weather systems. For precipitation, global-mean correlation with monthly-mean GPCP data is increased from 67\% to 77\%. In general, low-frequency variability is found to be well represented and from 10 hPa downwards general patterns of anomalies in temperature match those from the ERA-Interim, MERRA-2 and JRA-55 reanalyses.},

ECMWF provides a variety of data sets which differ in a number of parameters (available fields, spatial and temporal resolution, forecast start times, level types etc.). Therefore, the selection of the right data for a specific application and the settings needed to obtain them are not trivial. Consequently, the data sets which can be retrieved through flex\_extract by both member-state users and public users as well as their properties are explained. Flex\_extract 7.1.2 is a substantially revised version with completely restructured code, mainly written in Python 3, which is introduced with all its input and output files and an explanation of the four application modes.

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Lagrangian particle dispersion models require interpolation of all meteorological input variables to the position in space and time of computational particles. The widely used model FLEXPART uses linear interpolation for this purpose, implying that the discrete input fields contain point values. As this is not the case for precipitation (and other fluxes) which represent cell averages or integrals, a preprocessing scheme is applied which ensures the conservation of the integral quantity with the linear interpolation in FLEXPART, at least for the temporal dimension. However, this mass conservation is not ensured per grid cell, and the scheme thus has undesirable properties such as temporal smoothing of the precipitation rates. Therefore, a new reconstruction algorithm was developed, in two variants. It introduces additional supporting grid points in each time interval and is to be used with a piecewise linear interpolation to reconstruct the precipitation time series in FLEXPART. It fulfils the desired requirements by preserving the integral precipitation in each time interval, guaranteeing continuity at interval boundaries, and maintaining non-negativity. The function values of the reconstruction algorithm at the sub-grid and boundary grid points constitute the degrees of freedom, which can be prescribed in various ways. With the requirements mentioned it was possible to derive a suitable piecewise linear reconstruction. To improve the monotonicity behaviour, two versions of a filter were also developed that form a part of the final algorithm. Currently, the algorithm is meant primarily for the temporal dimension. It was shown to significantly improve the reconstruction of hourly precipitation time series from 3-hourly input data. Preliminary considerations for the extension to additional dimensions are also included as well as suggestions for a range of possible applications beyond the case of precipitation in a Lagrangian particle model.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Abstract In the Arctic, impurities in the atmosphere and cryosphere
can strongly affect the atmospheric radiation and surface energy balance. While
black carbon has hence received much attention, mineral dust has been in the
background. Mineral dust is not only transported into the Arctic from remote
regions but also, possibly increasingly, generated in the region itself. Here we
study mineral dust in the Arctic based on global transport model simulations.
For this, we have developed a dust mobilization scheme in combination with the
Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART. A model evaluation, based on
measurements of surface concentrations and annual deposition at a number of
stations and aircraft vertical profiles, shows the suitability of this model to
study global dust transport. Simulations indicate that about 3\% of global dust
emission originates from high-latitude dust sources in the Arctic. Due to
limited convection and enhanced efficiency of removal, dust emitted in these
source regions is mostly deposited closer to the source than dust from for
instance Asia or Africa. This leads to dominant contributions of local dust
sources to total surface dust concentrations (~85\%) and dust deposition (~90\%)
in the Arctic region. Dust deposition from local sources peaks in autumn, while
dust deposition from remote sources occurs mainly in spring in the Arctic. With
increasing altitude, remote sources become more important for dust
concentrations as well as deposition. Therefore, total atmospheric dust loads in
the Arctic are strongly influenced by Asian (~38\%) and African (~32\%) dust,
whereas local dust contributes only 27\%. Dust loads are thus largest in spring
when remote dust is efficiently transported into the Arctic. Overall, our study
shows that contributions of local dust sources are more important in the Arctic
than previously thought, particularly with respect to surface concentrations and
dust deposition.},

abstract = {A soil-derived dust emission scheme has been designed to provide an
explicit representation of the desert dust sources for the atmospheric transport
models dealing with the simulation of the desert dust cycle. Two major factors
characterizing the erodible surface are considered: (1) the size distribution of
the erodible loose particles of the soil which controls the erosion threshold
and the emission strength and (2) the surface roughness which imposes the
efficient wind friction velocity acting on the erodible surface. These two
parameters are included in a formulation of the threshold wind friction velocity
by adapting a size-dependent parameterization proposed by Iversen and White
(1982) and by applying to the rough erodible surfaces a drag partition scheme
derived from Arya (1975). This parameterization of the threshold friction
velocity has been included in an horizontal flux equation proposed by White
(1979). This allows to attribute a specific production rate to each soil size
range for each type of surface. The dust flux F is then considered as a fraction
of the total horizontal flux G, the value of the ratio F/G being imposed, at
this time, by the soil clay content. In summary, the computed mass fluxes depend
on the soil size distribution, the roughness lengths, and the wind friction
velocity. The different steps of this scheme have been independently validated
by comparison with relevant experimental data. Globally, the agreement is
satisfying, so that the dust fluxes could be retrieved with less uncertainties
than those observed in previous simulations of the desert dust cycle.},

uplifting of dust particles is expressed as a function of surface wind speed and
wetness. The GOCART model is driven by the assimilated meteorological fields
from the Goddard Earth Observing System Data Assimilation System (GEOS DAS)
which facilitates direct comparison with observations. The model includes seven
size classes of mineral dust ranging from 0.1–6 μm radius. The total annual
emission is estimated to be between 1604 and 1960 Tg yr−1 in a 5-year
simulation. The model has been evaluated by comparing simulation results with
ground-based measurements and satellite data. The evaluation has been performed
by comparing surface concentrations, vertical distributions, deposition rates,
optical thickness, and size distributions. The comparisons show that the model
results generally agree with the observations without the necessity of invoking
any contribution from anthropogenic disturbances to soils. However, the model
overpredicts the transport of dust from the Asian sources to the North Pacific.
This discrepancy is attributed to an overestimate of small particle emission
from the Asian sources.},

Israel were analyzed by a scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersed
system (SEM-EDS). The analysis shows that the particles were mostly aggregates
of varying mineralogical composition rather than pure minerals. It is also shown
that sulfur (not associated with gypsum) and, to a lesser extent, iron tended to
reside on the particles' surface, while Ca, Mg, K, Al, and Si were all an
integral part of the particles. The lack of NaCl and sulfuric acid aerosols in
the sample indicates that the air mass did not interact with marine air or with
clouds. This conclusion is further supported by back trajectory calculations.
These findings suggest that the sulfur in the aerosols did not result from
atmospheric processes but rather originated from processes in the source region.
Black residue, surrounding some of the particles, suggests the possible
existence of organic matter in the sample, probably originating from biological
activity in the soil at the source of the particles. The method of individual
particle analysis provides important information about the composition and
morphology of the particles, information that otherwise cannot be obtained by

Over the following days, the space-borne lidar CALIOP tracked an optically thin, highly elevated, horizontally extensive dust veil that was transported intercontinentally over eastern Asia, the Pacific Ocean, North America, and the Atlantic Ocean. A global aerosol transport model (SPRINTARS) simulated the dust veil quite well and provided a three-dimensional view of the intercontinental dust transport. The SPRINTARS simulation revealed that the dust veil traveled at 4–10 km altitudes with a thickness of 1–4 km along the isentropic surface between 310 and 340 K. The transport speed was about 1500 km/day. The estimated dust amount exported to the Pacific was 30.8 Gg, of which 65\% was deposited in the Pacific and 18\% was transported to the North Atlantic. These results imply that dust veils can fertilize open oceans, add to background dust, and affect the radiative budget at high altitudes through scattering and absorption. {\textless}br{\textgreater}{\textless}br{\textgreater} The injection mechanism that lifts dust particles into the free atmosphere is important for understanding the formation of the dust veil and subsequent long-range transport. We used a regional dust transport model (RC4) to analyze the dust emission and injection over the source region. The RC4 analysis revealed that strong northeasterly surface winds associated with low pressures invaded the Taklimakan Desert through the eastern corridor. These winds then formed strong upslope wind along the high, steep mountainsides of the Tibetan Plateau and blew large amounts of dust into the air. The updraft lifted the dust particles farther into the upper troposphere (about 9 km above mean sea level, MSL), where westerlies are generally present. The unusual terrain surrounding the Taklimakan Desert played a key role in the injection of dust to the upper troposphere to form the dust veil.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},
