\section{Trajectory analysis in FLEXPART}
In order to understand the inter annual variation of the dust deposition it is neccesary to know how the dust is transported. However due to how the trajectory information is stored in FLEXPART doing this kind of analysis is difficult. In FLEXPART it is possible to get trajectory information for each particle release, which include the centriod trajectory of all the particles in addition to
