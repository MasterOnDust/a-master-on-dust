    name=Tracer,
    description={An atmospheric tracer a substance that passively that can be used to track the movements of air. There exist both tracers eg. smoke from wildfire or mineral dust, and anthropogenic tracers eg. radio active particles from a nuclear disaster. Another common use of tracer is when talking about trace gasses, which are all the gases in the atmosphere other than the most oxygen (20.9 \%), nitrogen (78.1 \%) and argon (0.98\%). }

    description={The friction velocity describe flux of the momentum transferred between the atmosphere and the ground and is not a velocity in the transitional sense. The friction velocity is defined as 
    \begin{equation}
        u^2_* = \left|\tau_{Reynolds}\right|/\rho
